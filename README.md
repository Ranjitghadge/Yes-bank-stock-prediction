## ðŸ“– Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the stock price of Yes Bank, a leading Indian financial services company, using machine learning algorithms. Historical stock prices and various features such as Opening, Closing, Highest, and Lowest prices are utilized to make these predictions. The machine learning algorithms employed in this project include Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.

## ðŸ“– Problem Statement

Yes Bank, a prominent bank in the Indian financial domain, has been in the news since 2018 due to a fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. This project aims to analyze how such incidents impact the stock prices of the company and determine the effectiveness of time series or other predictive models in such scenarios. The dataset used in this project comprises monthly stock prices of Yes Bank from its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices for each month. The objective is to predict the closing price of the stock for each month.

## ðŸ“– Data Summary

The dataset used in this project contains monthly stock prices of Yes Bank from 2010 to 2021. In addition to stock prices, it includes various features such as company financials (e.g., revenue, net income), economic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation), and news sentiment (e.g., positive/negative news articles). The dataset comprises 133 monthly observations, with each observation containing the following variables:

- Date: The date (Month and Year provided)
- Open: The stock price at the beginning of the time period
- High: The maximum price at which the stock traded during the period
- Low: The lowest price at which the stock traded during the period
- Close: The trading price at the end of the month

The main objective is to predict the closing price of the stock for each month.

## ðŸ“– Conclusion

The maximum accuracy achieved in this project was 82%. The R-squared values for Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression were similar. However, the ElasticNet model showed the lowest R-squared value and higher MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The closing, opening, and high prices of the stock were found to be strongly correlated with each other.
